map pid output values 
map servo input values after pid calculation in set_servo funtion(set_pan, set_tilt):
    Now pid output values are set only if in range -90 to 90.
    
//Reasons for selection of towerpro: weight of cam, weight of system, stalling torque of 1.8kg/cm, speed 
According to the towerPro sg 90 datasheet:  
    //Dutycycle ranges from 1ms to 2ms with 1.5ms as midpoint
    //With the PWM frequency as 50Hz, period = 20ms.
    //Therefore: 1ms/20ms = 5%
                1.5ms/20ms = 7.5%
                2ms/20ms = 10%

Dutycycle calculation equation: angle/18. + 3, 
where the bias term 3 is used to account for the fact that when the angle is zero the neutral point of the pan motor, 
the dutycycle should be 5% 

Change dutyCycle calculation bias to 8. 
    -90/18 + 8 = 3%
    0/18 + 8 = 8%
    90/18 + 8 = 13%
This is a closer approximation than a bias of 2 or 3.

This comes from the error calculation as:
    setPoint - actualValue = :
    framecenter - objectCenter

    This is negative when the person is to the left,    
    for which pid update output results to a value 0 to -90%, 
    for which the duty cycle calculation results range from 3% to 8%, panning the camera to the left,
    with further left locations of object giving larger errors close to abs(-90%), hence dutycycles closer to 3%, which is equivalent
    to 1ms for all way left according to the towerPro sg90 datasheet.

    This is positive when the person is to the right, 
    for which pid update output results to a value 0 to 90%, 
    for which the duty cycle calculation results range from 8% to 13%, panning the camera to the right,
    with further right locations of object giving larger errors close to 90%, hence dutycycles closer to 13%, which is equivalent
    to 2ms for all way right according to the towerPro sg90 datasheet.
