Put lowpass filter to filter small detection changes and avoid flooding noisy data to motors
Calibrate camera (and motors) to choose point where:
 framecenter = objcenter, thus PID error = 0, motors = still

Find reason for pan and tilt conflation.
Write the code out in one line so it runs linearly rather than using multiprocessing.
    Now that I am not using Manager.value to share process variables, I can have these as globals.
    More sequential run. 
    Easier to measure metrics.

    multiprocessing way:
        Locking Mechanisms: If necessary, use locks (Lock or RLock)
         to synchronize access to shared resources to avoid data corruption.
         Take case where servo is writing previous detection output while detection has moved
         on, and this being non-deterministic thus introducing entropy in servo movements
