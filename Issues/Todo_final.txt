//Response too sensitive
1. Change ki, kd - plotted but kp = 0.15 works fine, ki = 0.01, kd = 0.001
2. Use low pass filter for detection results --> fitted in set_pan
3. Change to pigpio -- not necessitated

Done:
I want to plot the data out in a table in excel format with time, input and output, 
for all input ranges of error from -320 to 320 and all output ranges of angle from -90 to 90.
 Assume time increments of 0.5 seconds and angle increments of 30 degrees

Result: 
    In managersim1pstreamfilter.py, the camera faces where I was last seen without jitter
    but does not follow movement. 
        Check -1*pan_angle.Value as well as 
        if angle increments of 5 affect or 
        if any time delays
